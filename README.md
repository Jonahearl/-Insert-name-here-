As you read through this you will see I am making attempts to produce a PET bottle recycler to turn them into PET filament with a diameter of 1.75mm for FDM 3d printing.

# Planned Process of events
* Initially I want to refine the cutting of the bottles to be accurate. This accuracy is important so that the filament can more accurately be sized for when it comes out of the modified hotend.
* Then I would like to design the actual extruder with a hotend drilled out to 1.5mm nozzle which will likely be heated with a 12V ceramic heater catridge.
* Following the extruder the next part on the list will be the spool holder and winder which will be spun using a nema 17 stepper motor most likely.
* I guess at this point it will be time to then write some fancy code which I totally know how to do on a arduino nano for command functions and temperature control.
* Either here or one step earlier I will design a frame probably using aluminium extrusions or wood to host all of the features.
* Then it'll be time to create a PCB to mount it all to which I will most likely power off of a old ATX power supply which are in quite high supply to me.
* Some very serious and not at all unrequired testing will take place at this point?
* If time permits i will work on the physical aspects of a filament welder as I am hoping to just chuck the feature in the code or something?

I feel like that isn't entirely the way that bullet points should work but hey, oh well.

Also fun fact cardboard is a really good insulator up until about like 200 degrees C and then it does go fwoosh but still.
